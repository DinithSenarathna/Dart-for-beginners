/*
Introduction to the Dart inheritance

Inheritance allows you to define a class that extends the functionality of another class.

Dart supports single inheritance. It means that a class can inherit from a single class. Dart doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances. In other words, a class cannot inherit from two or more classes.
